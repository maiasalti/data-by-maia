I've lived in both seasonal and non-seasonal countries (Singapore and the United Kingdom) during my life and I have seen the real effects of how the seasons can change your mood. Coming out of school at 4pm in London to see the sun setting wasn't exactly a fun childhood experience for me.

I also really love music, and I definitely go from phases of sad and depressing music, to phases of hard metal rock music, to my annual Taylor Swift phase (usually after a break up). I wondered if the weather had any effect on the music that I listen to, and if tropical places, such as Singapore, tend to have a higher proportion of "happy" song listens all year round.

## The Hypothesis

The theory seems intuitive: when daylight shrinks and temperatures drop, we gravitate toward music that reflects our mood. Meanwhile, countries near the equator—where it's perpetually summer—should show stable musical preferences throughout the year.

I tested this by comparing Spotify chart data from:

**Seasonal countries:** US, UK, Sweden, Germany, Canada, France, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Switzerland, Denmark, Finland

**Tropical countries:** Singapore, Australia, Brazil, Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Mexico, Venezuela, Colombia

Using Spotify's "valence" metric, which measures musical happiness on a 0-100% scale, I tracked how songs in the top-200 charts changed across seasons and months.

## The Seasonal Happiness Curve

The data reveals a clear pattern in seasonal countries: musical happiness drops to its lowest in winter (48.9%) and peaks in spring (55.8%)—not summer as you might expect. That's a 7-percentage-point swing that represents millions of people unconsciously coordinating their emotional soundtracks.

Tropical countries, meanwhile, hover consistently around 52-56% valence with minimal seasonal variation. Their "winter" shows barely any decrease compared to the signfificant drops in places like Sweden or Canada.

## Month-by-Month: The Real Pattern

Looking at monthly trends, the seasonal effect becomes even clearer. February hits the emotional low point (49.6% valence), while April represents the peak (57.0%). This aligns more with daylight patterns than temperature—suggesting seasonal affective patterns drive the change.

Notice how tropical countries maintain a relatively flat line throughout the year, with only minor fluctuations. Their preferences seem driven more by global cultural trends than local weather patterns.

## The Verdict

So we really do gravitate toward different music in winter: at least in places where winter exists. The 7-point seasonal swing in musical happiness is statistically significant and represents a real psychological phenomenon affecting millions of listeners.

But the effect is more nuanced than "sad songs for sad seasons." I believe that it's about amplifying our emotions and using music to lean into whatever we're already feeling.

Regardless of whether we feel happy or sad, there’s something valuable about simply feeling, about having the lows of winter that make the highs of summer shine brighter. The real question, then, is who has the richer experience: those in non-seasonal climates, where emotions run steadier, or those who live through winters and summers, riding the full swing between lows and highs?

## The Methodology

**Data sources:**
- 35,118 matched chart entries from Spotify Charts (2022-2024)  
- 114,000 tracks with audio feature analysis  
- Weekly top 200 charts by country  
- 35.1% match rate between chart and audio feature data  

**Key limitations:**
- Chart data reflects popularity, not individual listening habits  
- Cultural factors beyond weather influence musical taste  
- Sample focused on countries with robust Spotify data  
- December data showed anomalies (likely due to holiday music and data sparsity)  

**Audio features explained:**
- **Valence:** Musical positivity (0% = sad, 100% = happy)  
- **Energy:** Perceived intensity and power  
- **Danceability:** Rhythm and beat strength  
- **Acousticness:** Acoustic vs. electronic instrumentation
