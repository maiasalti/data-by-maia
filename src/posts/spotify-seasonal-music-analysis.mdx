I’ve spent parts of my life in both seasonal and non-seasonal countries, Singapore and the United Kingdom, and it’s made me notice just how much the weather can mess with your mood. I still remember walking out of school in London at 4pm only to find the sky already dark. As a kid, that felt pretty miserable.

Music has always been my way of leaning into whatever mood I’m in. Sometimes it’s sad, heavy songs, other times it’s loud metal, and then my annual Taylor Swift phase (usually after a breakup). It got me thinking: does the climate we live in actually shape the kind of music we gravitate toward? Do people in places like Singapore, where it’s always sunny, listen to “happy” songs more consistently than those of us who endure long, grey winters?

## The Hypothesis

The theory seems intuitive: when daylight shrinks and temperatures drop, we gravitate toward music that reflects our mood. Whereas countries near the equator, where it's always a summer climate, should show stable musical preferences throughout the year.

I tested this by comparing Spotify chart data from:

**Seasonal countries:** US, UK, Sweden, Germany, Canada, France, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Switzerland, Denmark, Finland

**Tropical countries:** Singapore, Brazil, Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Mexico, Venezuela, Colombia

Using Spotify's "valence" metric, which measures musical happiness on a 0-100% scale, I tracked how songs in the top-200 charts changed across seasons and months.

## The Seasonal Happiness Curve

<ValenceComparisonChart />

The data reveals a clear pattern in seasonal countries: musical happiness drastically drops to its lowest in winter (48.9%) and peaks in spring (55.8%), not summer as you might expect. That's a 7 percent swing that shows millions of people unconsciously changing their emotional soundtracks.

Tropical countries, meanwhile, hover consistently around 52-56% valence with low seasonal variation. Their "winter" shows less of a decrease compared to the signfificant drops in places like Sweden or Canada.

## Month-by-Month: The Real Pattern

<SeasonalTrendLine />

Looking at monthly trends, the seasonal effect becomes even clearer. February hits the emotional low point (49.6% valence), while April represents the peak (57.0%). This aligns more with daylight patterns than temperature, potentially indicating that mood may correlate with sunlight exposure.

## The Verdict

So it seems we may gravitate toward different music in winter, even more so in places where "true winter" exists. The 7-point swing in musical happiness is statistically significant and represents a real psychological phenomenon affecting millions of listeners.

But the effect is more nuanced than "sad songs for sad seasons." I believe that it's about amplifying our emotions and using music to lean into whatever we're already feeling.

Regardless of whether we feel happy or sad, there’s something valuable about simply feeling, about having the lows of winter that make the highs of summer shine brighter. The real question, then, is who has the richer experience: those in non-seasonal climates, where emotions run steadier, or those who live through winters and summers, riding the full swing between lows and highs?

## The Methodology

**Data sources:**
- 35,118 matched chart entries from Spotify Charts (2022-2024)  
- 114,000 tracks with audio feature analysis  
- Weekly top 200 charts by country  
- 35.1% match rate between chart and audio feature data  

**Key limitations:**
- Chart data reflects popularity, not individual listening habits  
- Cultural factors beyond weather influence musical taste  
- Sample focused on countries with robust Spotify data  
- December data showed anomalies (likely due to holiday music and data sparsity)  

**Audio features explained:**
- **Valence:** Musical positivity (0% = sad, 100% = happy)  
- **Energy:** Perceived intensity and power  
- **Danceability:** Rhythm and beat strength  
- **Acousticness:** Acoustic vs. electronic instrumentation
